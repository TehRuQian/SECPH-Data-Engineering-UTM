# Data Structures and Algorithms
This course covers the theoretical and practical aspects of data structures, including abstract data types, recursion, Big O analysis, sorting and searching techniques. Linear structures is implemented like linked lists, stacks, and queues, as well as non-linear structures like trees and binary search trees, through class-based programming and group projects.
