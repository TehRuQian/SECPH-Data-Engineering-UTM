# Data Structures and Algorithms
This course covers the theoretical and practical aspects of data structures, including abstract data types, recursion, Big O analysis, sorting and searching techniques. Linear structures is implemented like linked lists, stacks, and queues, as well as non-linear structures like trees and binary search trees, through class-based programming and group projects.

## Project: Interview Simulation System
A menu-driven system that uses a queue-based data structure to manage and schedule candidate interviews. It automates time slot assignments, distinguishes between waiting and processed applicants, and offers an intuitive interface for interview coordination.

## Reflection
This course provided a solid foundation in data structures and algorithm analysis, bridging theory and practical application through class-based programming. It deepened my understanding of core concepts like recursion, Big O notation, and abstract data types, while hands-on implementation of stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees enhanced my coding fluency. Group assignments and the mini project fostered collaboration and problem-solving, making the learning experience both engaging and impactful.
