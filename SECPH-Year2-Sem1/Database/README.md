# Database
This course explores database concepts and their real-world applications. Database design techniques is learnt, including ER diagrams, normalization, and SQL, and use DBMS tools to develop a database application for an actual organization through hands-on project work.

## Project : KKK Online System 
This project proposes tailored solutions to improve the operational efficiency of Koperasi Kakitangan Daerah Kelantan Berhad (KADA), focusing on digitizing its member registration and loan application processes. It includes a thorough investigation of current manual workflows, identification of key challenges, and development of a strategic plan—from information gathering and system analysis to interface design and prototyping—to support a modernized and user-friendly application system.

## Reflection
This course gave me a practical understanding of how to design and build database systems using real-world techniques like ER diagrams, normalization, and SQL. Working on a live project helped me apply these concepts in a meaningful way and improved my ability to develop efficient, user-focused database applications.
