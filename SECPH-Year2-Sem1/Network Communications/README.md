# Network Communications
This course introduces key concepts in computer networking and data communication using a top-down approach based on the TCP/IP model. It covers real-world applications, technical fundamentals, and helps to develop a clear understanding of how networks operate.

## Project : FC Network Infrastructure Upgrade
The Faculty of Computing is upgrading its network to support future growth and improve digital infrastructure. A new two-storey building will be built with four labs—two general, one for networking, and one for IoT—each with 30 workstations and fast internet. It will also include a video conferencing room and a WiFi-equipped student lounge. The network will be scalable, secure, and easy to manage, with features like VPN access, access control, and support for modern technologies. This upgrade ensures reliable connectivity and better support for teaching, learning, and collaboration.

## Reflection
This course gave me a practical understanding of how computer networks operate using the TCP/IP model. I learned how common applications rely on data communication and how each layer in the protocol stack contributes to performance, reliability, and security. The top-down approach helped me see the relevance of networking concepts in real-world scenarios, and now I appreciate the complexity and importance of network infrastructure in modern technology.
