# Software Engineering
This course introduces an engineering-based approach for developing high-quality software systems. It covers key software engineering concepts, process models, and development phases such as requirements analysis, design, and testing. Hands-on experience is gained with object-oriented methods like UML to analyze and design software, preparing them to produce essential software artifacts and deliverables.

## Reflection
This course helped me understand core software engineering principles and how they apply across the software development life cycle. I gained practical experience in requirement analysis, design, and testing, and learned to use tools like UML for object-oriented modeling. It gave me a clearer view of how structured engineering approaches lead to more reliable and maintainable software.
