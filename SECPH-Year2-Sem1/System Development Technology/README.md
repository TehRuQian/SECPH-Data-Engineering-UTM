# System Development Technology
This course introduces key technologies and tools used in modern system development. It covers system architecture, development methodologies, programming frameworks, and deployment strategies—providing practical skills for designing, building, and maintaining scalable software solutions.

## Individual Assignment : Course Registration System
This Course Registration System is an online platform designed to streamline course management for students, lecturers, and administrators. Students can register for courses, update profiles, and view academic records. Lecturers manage their assigned courses and access student information. Administrators maintain the system, handle course data, and oversee registrations—all within an efficient and user-friendly interface.

## Reflection
This course provided a valuable foundation in practical system design and development. Through my contribution to the KKK Online System—particularly the Loan and Admin Reporting Modules—I applied core concepts such as modular design, user interface development, backend processing, and system integration. I strengthened my technical writing and documentation skills while learning the importance of testing and validation for reliable functionality.

Beyond programming, the experience taught me how to align system goals with user needs and administrative operations, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and usability. Overall, it deepened my understanding of end-to-end development and highlighted how thoughtful design and collaboration can create impactful digital solutions.
