# Digital Logic
All microprocessor-based systems, including those in computers, robotics, cars, and industrial control systems, are built on digital electronics. In addition to giving students an extensive review of numerous crucial ideas, elements, and techniques, this course exposes them to digital electronics. The most recent information on digital fundamentals from basic concepts to programmable logic devices will be taught to students. Practical experience with the simulator software, real devices, and circuits covered in class is provided by laboratory experiments.
