# Programming Technique I
This course, which covers a foundational subject, gives students theory and practice in structured problem-solving strategies. To address easy to moderate issues, students must write programs in the C++ programming language. The program covers the following topics: file operations, pointers, built-in and user-defined functions, sequential, selection, and loop control structures; preprocessor directives; constants and variables; data types; input and output statements; and structured data types.
