# Operating System
This course introduces the fundamental concepts of operating systems as the bridge between users and computer hardware. It covers essential topics like process management, memory and file systems, concurrency, deadlock handling, and I/O operations— with the core techniques and algorithms used in OS design.

## Project : Virtual Memory Management – Replacement Algorithm: FIFO, LRU
This project simulates page replacement algorithms—FIFO and LRU—using a chef analogy to explain virtual memory management. Implemented in C++, the simulation shows how LRU reduces page faults more effectively than FIFO. The outcome highlights the importance of selecting efficient strategies to optimize system performance.

## Reflection
This course offered a holistic view of operating systems, blending theoretical concepts with hands-on practice. Through simulations and real-world analogies, I gained a deeper understanding of memory management, process scheduling, and system efficiency. It challenged me to think critically, design thoughtfully, and appreciate how low-level decisions impact overall performance. The practical exercises helped solidify key ideas and highlighted the relevance of OS principles in everyday computing.
