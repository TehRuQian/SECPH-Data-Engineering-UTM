## Project : Hospital Appointment Management
The Hospital Appointment Management System is a Java-based desktop application developed to help hospital administrators efficiently manage patient information, doctor records, appoinment and medical records.

This system features a user-friendly Java Swing GUI, allowing administrators to:
* Add new doctors and patients
* Schedule and cancel appointments
* View doctor-specific appoinment schedules
* Create and update medical records for patients

This system improves workflow, minimizes human error in scheduling and ensures organized data management in a clinical setting.
