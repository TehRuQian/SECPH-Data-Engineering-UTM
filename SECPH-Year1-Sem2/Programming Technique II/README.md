## Project : Seft-Checkout System
This project develops a self-checkout system designed to streamline the physical shopping experience. It enables customers to scan, bag, and pay for items independently, reducing wait times and improving convenience. For store managers, it offers cost-saving benefits and helps enhance the in-store environment.
