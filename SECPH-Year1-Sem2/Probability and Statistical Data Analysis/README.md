# Probability and Statistical Data Analysis
This course introduces statistical techniques for data analysis. It covers data types from daily and industrial sources, visual representation, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and model fitting. Students learn to apply statistical models using software tools to extract insights from data.

## Project 1 : Student Spending Habits Survey
This project explores financial management and spending behaviors among UTM students. It aims to:
1. Analyze monthly income and expenses of UTM students
2. Identify spending patterns across categories like food, entertainment, transportation, groceries, and healthcare
3. Investigate factors influencing financial habits
4. Assess the need for financial aid among students

## Project 2 : QS World University Rankings Analysis
This project investigates key performance metrics that influence the rankings of the top 500 universities in the QS World University Rankings 2025. Using statistical methods—such as hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, and goodness of fit tests—it aims to:
1. Analyze academic, employer reputation, and institutional size data
2. Identify dependencies and significant factors affecting global rankings
3. Offer insights into what sets top institutions apart in higher education

## Reflection
This course provided a solid foundation in data analysis, visualization, and statistical reasoning. Through hands-on exercises, real-world datasets, and project-based learning, I deepened my understanding of tools like R concept. It sharpened my problem-solving skills, especially in debugging and handling complex data scenarios.
