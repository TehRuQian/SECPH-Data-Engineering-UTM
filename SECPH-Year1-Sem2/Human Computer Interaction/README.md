## Project : TakeNGo – The Future of Shopping
TakeNGo is a smart, cashier-less shopping solution designed to eliminate queues and enhance accessibility.

## Reflection
This course deepened my appreciation for the user-centered design mindset, showing how theory and practice intersect through iterative UX lifecycles. I gained hands-on experience in contextual inquiry, ideation, and formative evaluation—understanding that creating meaningful digital experiences goes beyond usability to embrace usefulness and emotional impact. It taught me to think with empathy and design with intention.
