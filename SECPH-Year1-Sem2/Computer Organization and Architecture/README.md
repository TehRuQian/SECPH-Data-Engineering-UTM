## Project
This project compares CPU performance across four Windows-based computers using tools like CPU-Z, Geekbench, Task Manager, and MiniTool Partition Wizard. It also evaluates CPU efficiency by running a basic Assembly program on each system to measure execution time and performance differences.

## Reflection
This course provided a solid foundation in understanding how computers function at the hardware level. I gained insights into CPU architecture, memory management, instruction execution, and benchmarking tools. The hands-on projects and performance comparisons deepened my appreciation for system-level efficiency and real-world application of theoretical concepts.
